# Propel-Theme 
Over the last couple of years I've been re-trained from Heavy Duty Mechanics to I.T. and attended the Academy of Learning with honors . I have a strong aptitude for working with technology, problem solving and strong desire to learn.

Presently taking online classes(Udemy) in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and etc as prep for a Frontend Web Developer position.
